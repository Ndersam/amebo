        <link href="http://www.nairaland.com/5922894/started-sleeping-daughters-because-wife"/>
        <summary type="html"><blockquote>A 50-year-old father, Peter Ayemoba, has been arrested by the police for having carnal knowledge of his two daughters.<br><br>Ayemoba told the police during interrogation that he had been sleeping with his daughters since his wife died about seven years ago.<br><br>He said that sleeping with his daughters made him to feel close to his late wife, adding that the romps he had with them allowed them to bond more.<br><br>Ayemoba said: “I started sleeping with my daughters about seven years ago when I lost my wife in 2013.<br><br><b>“The death of my wife got me so confused that I did not even know when I started sleeping with my daughters.</b><br><br>“In fact, I don’t know what has come over me.<br><br>“The death of my wife devastated me to the point that I did not know what I was doing.<br><b><br>“I suspect that somebody placed a curse on me, because what I have done in the past seven years is not ordinary, frankly speaking.<br><br>“What I did after my wife’s death was to bond with my children and they became closer to me until gradually I started sleeping with the girls.</b><br><br>“Honestly, I cannot explain why I should do that to my own daughters. But there was a spirit that kept telling me that I would not be the first man to sleep with his daughter and at such, I should not worry too much about it.”<br><br>Ayemoba insisted that he got the consent of his daughters before sleeping with them, adding that it was with their consent that the relationship continued even after he took a second wife.<br><br>He said: “After my wife’s burial, I started having feelings for my daughters. I would go to their room and play with them until it metamorphosed to having sexual intercourse with them separately on a regular basis but with their consent.<br><br>“Whenever they rejected my sexual demand, I would tell them that I wanted to be closer to them since their mother was no more.<br><br>“At times I would threaten to kill them and commit suicide if they did not allow me to sleep with them.<br><br>“One day, I had to refer them to the Bible about Lot who had sex with his daughters and was not punished by God.<br><br>“I told them that the intercourse between a father and his daughters was normal and it is written in the Bible.”<br><br>The father of six said his second wife was not aware of his romps with his daughters, neither did his four sons know about them.<br><br>He added that his daughters probably did not tell his second wife because they were not close to her.<br><br>He said: “My daughters, after noticing that I was doing something abominable, forced me to get another wife that would satisfy my sexual urge. But despite the marriage, I still made love to them at the slightest opportunity my new wife was not in the house.<br><br>“Honestly, what is happening to me is not ordinary. I need to go out to sort myself out either physically or metaphysically so that I will have peace of mind.”<br><br>Apparently tired of the sexual demands of their father, the girls decided to report to a family member who turned him in to the police.<br><br>Ayemoba, however, expressed surprise over the action of his daughters.<br><br>He said: “They voluntarily, willingly accepted to be having sex with me any time I demanded it.<br><br>“What baffles me is that for the number of years we were having sex, we were happy. Then all of a sudden, they reported the incident to a family member who brought us to where we are (police station). I am still surprised at what they did.”<br><br>“But maybe my cup has filled to the brim, so let the law take its course, I am ready for any eventualities.”</blockquote><br><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/thenationonlineng.net/i-started-sleeping-with-my-daughters-because-my-wife-died/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/thenationonlineng.net/i-started-sleeping-with-my-daughters-because-my-wife-died/amp/</a></summary>

        <title>Kim Jong Un's Sister Threatens Military Action Against South Korea</title>
        <link href="http://www.nairaland.com/5924701/kim-yo-jong-threatens-military"/>
        <summary type="html"><blockquote>The sister of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un bashed South Korea and has threatened military action after a recent decline in relations.<br><br>Kim Yo Jong took aim at the inter-Korean liaison office in the border town of Kaesong, promising a “tragic scene” after she accused Seoul of not doing enough to stop an anti-Pyongyang leaflet campaign, calling the liaison office “useless.” Activists regularly float balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets that criticize the leadership, a move that generally garners a furious response.<br><br>“By exercising my power authorized by the supreme leader, our party and the state, I gave an instruction to the arms of the department in charge of the affairs with [the] enemy to decisively carry out the next action,” she said in a statement carried by North Korean's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). &quot;Before long, a tragic scene of the useless North-South joint liaison office completely collapsed would be seen.”<br><br>Kim Yo Jong took a harsh stance and called defectors who helped with the leaflet campaign “human scum” and “mongrel dogs.”<br><br>In response to North Korea’s anger over the leaflets, South Korea’s government promised to press charges against defector groups that have been carrying out border protests. South Korea also said it would push new laws to ban activists from flying the leaflets across the border, though some worry that President Moon Jae-in is more concerned about a dream of reunification than the safety of his country.<br><br>Kim Yo Jong now serves as the Workers’ Party’s Central Committee first vice department director, an elevated position that grants her greater power over the party and, by extension, the country. When her brother Kim Jong Un disappeared from the public eye in April, rumors circulated that Kim Yo Jong would potentially replace him as leader of the country.<br><br>While her brother has made public appearances since then, Kim Yo Jong has taken a more prominent place in public dealings. She recently criticized South Korea, declaring the North would cut off all government and military communication and threatened to abandon the peace agreement reached by their leaders in 2018.<br><br>The drop in relations between North and South Korea comes at a time when denuclearization talks between Kim Jong Un and President Trump have stalled.<br><br>North Korea marked its two-year anniversary of the first summit between Kim Jong Un and President Trump by vowing to build up its armed forces to counter what it perceives as threats from the United States.<br><br>Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon also told Seoul to drop “nonsensical” talk about denuclearization.<br><br>“The question is whether there will be a need to keep holding hands shaken in Singapore, as we see that there is nothing of factual improvement to be made in the DPRK-U.S. [Democratic People's Republic of Korea-U.S.] relations simply by maintaining personal relations between our supreme leadership and the U.S. president,” Ri was quoted as saying.<br><br>“Never again will we provide the U.S. chief executive with another package to be used for [political] achievements without receiving any returns,” he added. “Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.”</blockquote>Source: <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-sister-promises-tragic-scene-military-action-south-korea">https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-sister-promises-tragic-scene-military-action-south-korea</a></summary>
